# [ShipTalkers](https://shiptalkers.dev/)
ShipTalkers is an open-source project by [Rhys Sullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan) who aims to bring transparency to the tech community on Twitter. It compares the number of tweets a user has sent with their actual code contributions (commits) to determine if they are truly "shipping code" or just "shiptalk."

## Features
- **User Comparison**: Compare the ratio of tweets to commits for any Twitter user to see if they are backing up their tweets with actual code contributions.
- **Special Titles**: Based on the tweet-to-commit ratio, users are assigned special titles ranging from "Grinder" (high commit ratio) to "Influencer" (low commit ratio).
- **Heatmap Calendar**: While streaming a user's heatmap calendar, their most commits in a day or biggest tweet will be displayed.
- **Similar Ratios**: See other users with similar tweet-to-commit ratios.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard sorted from the highest to lowest commit ratios.
- **Holiday Callouts**: Special callouts for tweeting, coding, or living during holidays.

## Upcoming Features
- While comparing users, show people with similar ratios.
- Have a leaderboard sorted from the highest to lowest commit ratios.
- For holidays, callout tweeting, coding, or living.

# TODO:
- [ ] After comparing, give them a special name i.e. "Indie Hacker," "Reply Guy," etc.
 - Special name ideas:
 - [ ] Special name for 5:0 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Grinder` - 3:1 commits to tweets
 - [ ] Special name for 2:1 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Perfectly Balanced` - 1:1 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Shiposter` - 1:2 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Indie Hacker` - 1:3 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Reply Guy` - 1:4 commits to tweets
 - [x] `Influencer` - 1:5 commits to tweets
- [ ] While streaming the heatmap calendar, pop in their most commits in a day or biggest tweet
- [ ] After comparing, show people with similar ratios
- [ ] Have a leaderboard, sorted from most to least commit ratios
- [ ] For holidays, callout tweeting, coding, or living
